# Getting started with VPC Beta 1 for Advanced Instances

Welcome to IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Beta for Advanced Virtual Server Instances with 100 Gbps Networking, Phase 1. In this beta release, you can use the API and UI to provision advanced instances with high performance, fast port speeds, and fast provisioning. 

Beta 1 offers basic VPC functionality that will be expanded in future releases. You can create a VPC and subnets, use stock images to set up advanced instances, and reserve floating IP addresses to enable your instances to communicate with the internet. You can then deploy your service or applications across the instances.

For a complete list of features that are included in this beta release, see [Supported features](about-vpc-beta.html).

For a general overview of IBM Cloud VPC, see [About VPC](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/vpc/about.html). Not all features described in the overview are included in this beta release.
